Improve Apple's repair policy to be more accommodating to marginalized customers.

For some customers who cannot access an Apple store in their neighborhood, going to an Apple store in another city is an expensive trip.

The mail-in replacement policy also puts customers at risks of not getting their faulty component (a power adapter in my case) accepted under warranty, and be charged the full amount of the new/replacement component and the shipping costs.

I rather Apple sent/ship me a labeled box for me to ship the faulty, malfunctioning power adapter to Apple, and receive the replacement/new power adapter later if they believe the faulty, malfunctioning power adapter (that they received from me) is covered under warranty (e.g., they believe I intentionally damaged it or it is not sufficiently damaged).

That way, if I do not receive the replacement/new power adapter, it is okay, since I cannot use the faulty, malfunctioning power adapter anyway. The shipment of a labeled box to me defrays shipping cost for me to send the faulty, malfunctioning power adapter to Apple. 

The only difference about my suggestion to the current policy is that my suggestion adds extra cost of shipping an empty box to Apple. This can be mitigated by mailing the return label and a payment for the box to me in an envelop, so that I can go to the courier service center (specified by Apple Inc. in the return label) and ship the faulty, malfunctioning power adapter to Apple using the return label and a box, paid for by Apple (using a voucher or payment receipt from Apple to obtain a box at the courier service center).
